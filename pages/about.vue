      This is <span class="font-bold">CorpoLingo™</span>, a lingo handbook meant
      for the new and the lost, wandering aimlessly in the ruthless reality of
      the Corporate World™. This handbook is made especially for the average
      executive who got thrown acronyms like it's the early 00's internet. To
      those who wish to perpetuate the illusion of know-it-all, to those who
      wish to save a minute of their working hour from asking a coworker to
      dissect a cryptic, 3 (sometimes 4) letter, alphabet-derived acronym, and
      to those who just wants to know WTH is going on; this handbook is for you.
      ✨✨
